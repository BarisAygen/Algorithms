# CS301-Dynamic-Programming
This phyton code dynamically finds a path for a robot which stays at the (0, 0) cell on a random-sized matrix and moves one block right or down. While moving, collects the coins on the matrix. Those coins are completely randomly placed.
Since robot can only move right or down, it needs to calculate the possible paths and the maximum number of coins for that paths. After the final calculation, the code plots the time graph.
